# “The Little Schemer” Notebook

My personal notebook to work with [The Little Schemer (4nd ed.)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/), using the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) implementation of Scheme.

Although most of the concepts I encountered in the book so far are not new to me, I have been enjoying the experience of rediscovering them in a much simpler and clearer way. I wish I had this book back when I was struggling with writing recursive functions, since it is such a fun and carefully designed introduction to all kinds of recursive processes.

Here is my previous notebook for [The Reasoned Schemer](https://github.com/formsandlines/reasoned-schemer-notebook), which I also enjoyed very much (so far).
